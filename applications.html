<h1>Applications</h1>
These applications were programmed by yours truly to be installed on a scambaiting virtual machine. 

<br>

<b>Note:</b> For .hta files, Windows might tell you "The publisher could not be verified," but the applications do not have viruses; Google scans them when they are downloaded. If you want to make sure, you can even upload the files to <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload">Virus Total</a> and check.

<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-az7Oft8iII_k8YmYZ1lUxapHpdu5eeE/view?usp=sharing">Fake Syskey (.hta):</a> If you have Syskey installed, uninstall it. Hide this file in your desktop and add a hotkey to it. Whenever a scammer tries to open syskey, use the hotkey to open this instead. Note: This syskey will not actually lock a computer.</li>

<br>

<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qhm25U8GCZjBlOqZQAK3nKS17gDpHaqA/view?usp=sharing">Nope Pad (.hta):</a> uninstall Notepad on your virtual machine and use this .hta file instead. Scammers will open it thinking it's Notepad, but anything they try to type will come out wrong and every four seconds, four different error messages will appear.</li>

<br>


<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SVGpGD13eHehFIPkmH45G7ZldCCfh_qo/view?usp=sharing">Remote Access Alert (.hta):</a> If you want to convince a scammer that he's not the only one scamming you, download this application and make a shortcut in your desktop. Link the shortcut to a keyboard shortcut, and voila! When you press that keyboard shortcut, this application that seems to be a feature of some remote access software will apear and hide your screen. Alt+f4 closes it.

<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GLw9ZXdngdvOLTv8VIQIE7LTv0Ysa6zt/view?usp=sharing">Scambaiting Chrome Extension (unpackaged chrome extension):</a> Unzip this file, go to Chrome, visit the <a href="chrome://extensions/">chrome://extensions/</a> page, turn on Developer Mode in the rop right corner, click the Load unpacked extension button and select the unzipped folder to install it. When installed, google.com will turn into the <a href="google.html">Rigged Google Search</a> from this site and will turn play.google.com into the <a href="google%20play.html">Rigged Google Play</a> from this site. Whenever you press "Alt + S" on Amazon, Ebay, Sephora, Walmart, Steam, and several other stores, the page will say <a href="https://norristownunion.neocities.org/frames/order%20placed.html">an order was placed</a>.<b>Note:</b> the extension is called "Epic Adblocker." This is just so that the scammer won't find it. Also, make sure you hide it in the chrome menu for the same reason.</li>
